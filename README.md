Magellan is a library for talking to REST APIs. It is intended to function as a flexible alternative to [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit).

It is not done, and it is not yet suitable for use by anyone.

It depends on AFNetworking and PromiseKit.

Roadmap:

- Magellan 1.0 will not depend on PromiseKit; it'll depend on some other promises library yet to be determined.
- There is no documentation, guides, anything yet.
- It's not in the cocoapods repository yet, thus cannot actually be installed anywhere.
- You can't set up cyclic relationships yet.
- The API is too verbose for actual use; better mapping sugar is forthcoming.
